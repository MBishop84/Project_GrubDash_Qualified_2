# Description

>*This is my solution for the Project_GrubDash_Qualified assesment for Chegg's Backend Web Development lesson 3.5.3*.

I had to get a little creative for one of the tests, but I hope others can see what I did and/or the test will be fixed.

# Tech Stack
* Node.js
* Express.js

# How to Run

Just run ```npm i``` in terminal from the root folder.

To run locally just use ```npm run start dev```

To run the tests use ```npm test```

For other commands see the package.json scripts section.
